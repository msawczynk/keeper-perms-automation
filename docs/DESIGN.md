# Low-Level Design: Keeper Permissions Provisioning System

### 1. Overview

This document outlines the low-level design for a system that automates the provisioning of Keeper record permissions to teams by managing a **per-team mirrored folder structure**.

**Core Principles:**
*   **Atomicity:** Each module has a single, well-defined responsibility.
*   **Idempotency:** Running the `apply` command multiple times with the same input will result in the same final state without causing errors.
*   **Configuration as Code:** All tool configuration will be stored within the Keeper vault itself.
*   **No Data Duplication:** Original records are never copied, only shared.
*   **Per-Team Isolation:** Each team gets its own complete folder structure mirror under a shared folder they can access.
*   **Root Folder Is Private:** The top-level management folder (`[Perms]`) is created as a regular *user* folder; team-specific shared folders are created underneath it.

### 2. Per-Team Folder Structure

**NEW ARCHITECTURE (Per-Team Structure):**
```
[Perms] (private root folder)
├── TeamA (shared folder) ← Team A has access
│   └── Clients/Client1/Development/Servers (private subfolders)
│       └── Records shared with Team A permissions
├── TeamB (shared folder) ← Team B has access  
│   └── Clients/Client1/Development/Servers (private subfolders)
│       └── Records shared with Team B permissions
└── TeamC (shared folder) ← Team C has access
    └── Clients/Client2/Production/Database (private subfolders)
        └── Records shared with Team C permissions
```

**Key Benefits:**
- ✅ **Teams can only access their own folder structure**
- ✅ **Perfect isolation between teams**
- ✅ **Complete folder hierarchy mirrored for each team**
- ✅ **Team permissions work correctly on shared folders**
- ✅ **Scalable to any number of teams**

### 2. Implementation Roadmap

The development will be executed in three phases, moving from a functional core to an enterprise-grade system.

**Implementation Status (Current):**
- ✅ **Phase 1**: Core Implementation (MVP) - COMPLETED
- ✅ **Phase 2**: Enterprise Readiness - COMPLETED  
- 🔄 **Phase 3**: Advanced Capabilities - IN PROGRESS

---

### **Phase 1: Core Implementation (MVP)** ✅ COMPLETED

*Goal: Establish the fundamental workflow of configuring, generating a template, and applying permissions.*

#### **2.1. Core Components** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
*   **Data Models (`keeper_auto/domain/models.py`)**: Implemented atomic models including `PermissionLevel`, `EntityUID`, `Team`, `Record`, `VaultFolder`, and `ConfigRecord`.
*   **SDK Client (`keeper_auto/infrastructure/keeper_adapter.py`)**: Implemented `get_folder_data`, `create_shared_folder`, `ensure_folder_path`, `share_record_to_folder`, and `add_team_to_shared_folder`.
*   **Atomic Services (`keeper_auto/application/services.py`)**:
    *   `AtomicValidationService`: CSV validation with duplicate detection and permission validation
    *   `AtomicTemplateService`: CSV template generation
    *   `AtomicProvisioningService`: Idempotent provisioning operations
    *   `ApplicationCoordinator`: Facade coordinating all services

#### **2.2. CLI (`cli.py` and `cli_refactored.py`)** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
*   Implemented the core commands: `configure`, `template`, `dry-run`, `apply`, `validate`.
*   Both legacy and refactored CLI versions available with full backward compatibility.
*   Safety features: `--max-records` (default 5000), `--force` override, proper exit codes.

#### **2.3. Atomic Architecture** ✅ IMPLEMENTED

The system follows a clean layered architecture with atomic components:

    end
    subgraph Application
        B[ApplicationCoordinator] --> C[AtomicValidationService]
        B --> D[AtomicProvisioningService]
        C --> E[CSV Validation & Duplicate Detection]

    subgraph External
        H --> J[(Keeper Vault)]
        G --> K[(Log Files)]
        I --> L[(Checkpoint Files)]
    end
```

#### 2.6 Phase 1 System Behavior ✅ IMPLEMENTED
This section details the specific rules, schemas, and algorithms for the MVP.

##### 2.6.1 CSV Template Schema ✅ IMPLEMENTED

| Column | Description | Required | Implementation Status |
|--------|-------------|----------|----------------------|
| `record_uid` | UID of the original Keeper record | ✓ | ✅ Validated |
| `title` | Record title (used for drift detection) | ✓ | ✅ Validated |
| `folder_path` | Original folder path (e.g., `/Finance/Payroll`) | ✓ | ✅ Validated |
| `<Team Name>` | One column per team. Acceptable values: `ro`, `rw`, `rws`, `mgr`, `admin`, or blank | — | ✅ Validated |

##### Permission Vocabulary Mapping ✅ IMPLEMENTED

| Cell Value | can_edit | can_share | manage_records | manage_users | Status |
|------------|----------|-----------|----------------|--------------|--------|
| `ro` (read-only) | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✅ Implemented |
| `rw` (read/write) | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✅ Implemented |
| `rws` (read/write/share) | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✅ Implemented |
| `mgr` (manage records) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✅ Implemented |
| `admin` (manage users) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✅ Implemented |

##### 2.6.2 Configuration Record (`Perms-Config`) JSON Schema ✅ IMPLEMENTED
```json
{
  "root_folder_name": "[Perms]",           // string, default "[Perms]"
  "included_teams": ["TEAM_UID", "…"],     // optional list, null = all teams
  "included_folders": ["FOLDER_UID", "…"], // optional list, null = all folders
  "excluded_folders": ["FOLDER_UID", "…"]  // list, default []
}
```
> The formal JSON-Schema definition lives at [`/docs/perms_config.schema.json`](docs/perms_config.schema.json) and is version-controlled for tooling integration. ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

##### 2.6.3 Per-Team Mirroring Algorithm ✅ IMPLEMENTED
1. Ensure root user folder `${root_folder_name}` exists (**private user folder**).
2. For each team that has permissions on a record:
   a. Create/locate team-specific shared folder under root: `[Perms]/TeamName`
   b. Create/locate the complete `folder_path` hierarchy as **private subfolders** under the team's shared folder
   c. Share the record to the deepest folder in the team's hierarchy
   d. Apply team permissions to the team's shared folder
3. Result: Each team gets their own complete mirrored folder structure with proper isolation.

```mermaid
graph TD
    R[[Root: [Perms] (private user folder)]]
    subgraph Team A Structure
        TA[TeamA]:::sf --> TA1[Clients]:::pf
        TA1 --> TA2[Client1]:::pf
        TA2 --> TA3[Development]:::pf
        TA3 --> TA4[Servers]:::pf
    end
    subgraph Team B Structure  
        TB[TeamB]:::sf --> TB1[Clients]:::pf
        TB1 --> TB2[Client1]:::pf
        TB2 --> TB3[Development]:::pf
        TB3 --> TB4[Servers]:::pf
    end
    subgraph Records
        REC1[Record: Dev Server]:::rec
    end
    R --> TA
    R --> TB
    REC1 -.->|shared to TeamA| TA4
    REC1 -.->|shared to TeamB| TB4
    classDef sf fill:#ffffff,stroke:#00b2ff,stroke-width:2px
    classDef pf fill:#f0f0f0,stroke:#666666,stroke-width:1px
    classDef rec fill:#fff2cc,stroke:#d6b656,stroke-width:1px
```

##### 2.6.4 Error Handling & Exit Codes ✅ IMPLEMENTED
| Condition | Exit-code | Behaviour | Implementation Status |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|----------------------|
| Validation errors prior to mutation | 1 | Abort command | ✅ Implemented |
| `apply` completed with ≥1 row failures | 1 | Continue processing; summarise errors | ✅ Implemented |
| All operations succeed | 0 | Normal completion | ✅ Implemented |

##### 2.6.5 Edge-Case Rules & Defaults ✅ IMPLEMENTED

| Topic | Design Decision | Implementation Status |
|-------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Blank team-permission cells | **No access.** A blank or whitespace-only cell removes any explicit permission for that team on the target shared folder. | ✅ Implemented |
| Duplicate `record_uid` rows | **Validation error.** The validator must reject CSVs where the same `record_uid` appears more than once. | ✅ Implemented |
| Case & whitespace handling | Header names and permission tokens are case-insensitive; leading/trailing whitespace is trimmed before processing. | ✅ Implemented |
| Formal JSON-Schema | The `Perms-Config` record adheres to the JSON-Schema draft-07 definition published in `/docs/perms_config.schema.json` (to be version-controlled). All fields include `default` keywords matching Section 2.6.2. | ✅ Implemented |
| Managed Folder (MF) support | Out-of-scope for Phase 1–2. If enabled later, the mirroring algorithm remains identical; only the folder-creation helper will switch between `shared_folder` and `managed_folder` types based on a new CLI flag `--use-managed-folders`. | 🔄 Future |
| Checkpoint / rollback | Each `apply` run writes an idempotent checkpoint file `checkpoint-<runID>.json` capturing created folders & links. A `--resume <file>` flag replays the remainder after a failure; a future `rollback` command will inverse operations that have a recorded checkpoint. | ✅ Implemented |
| `--max-records` safeguard | Default `5000`. If the CSV exceeds the limit the command aborts with exit-code 1 unless `--force` or `--max-records <N>` overrides the threshold. | ✅ Implemented |
| Logging format | Logs are newline-delimited JSON (`.jsonl`) with keys `ts` (RFC3339 UTC), `run_id`, `level`, `event`, and arbitrary `data` fields. | ✅ Implemented |

**Example log line:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
```json
{"ts":"2025-01-02T15:04:05Z","run_id":"cdef1234","level":"info","event":"share_record","data":{"record_uid":"ABCD","folder_uid":"XYZ"}}
```

##### 2.6.6 Operations & Retention Policies ✅ IMPLEMENTED
* **Checkpoint files** (`checkpoint-<runID>.json`) and **failed rows** CSVs are written to `./runs/YYYY-MM-DD/`.
* Retain last **30 days** locally; a nightly cron (or CI job) compresses and archives older runs to long-term storage (S3/Blob).
* Log files (`perms-apply-YYYYMMDD.log.jsonl`) follow the same retention and may optionally be uploaded to a Keeper "Perms-Log" record.

##### 2.6.7 Security Considerations ✅ DOCUMENTED
* Keeper Commander session cache is stored at `%APPDATA%/Keeper/commander/automation.json` (Windows) or `~/.config/keeper/commander/automation.json` (Unix). Restrict file permissions to the automation user (`chmod 600`).
* Run the tool under a dedicated least-privilege Keeper user account; avoid personal master accounts in CI.
* Environment variables `KPR_USER`, `KPR_PASS`, `KPR_2FA` should be injected from a secrets manager (e.g., GitHub Actions Secrets, HashiCorp Vault).

---

### **Phase 2: Enterprise Readiness** ✅ COMPLETED

*Goal: Harden the tool with robust error handling, improved usability, and foundational operational features.*

#### **2.7. Implementation Status: Phase 2** ✅ COMPLETED

*   ✅ **Configuration & Bootstrap**: Automatic discovery of the `Perms-Config` record implemented.
*   ✅ **Comprehensive Validation**:
    *   Strict validation of the CSV (permissions vocabulary, structure) implemented.
    *   Duplicate `record_uid` detection implemented.
    *   Complete permission vocabulary validation (`ro`, `rw`, `rws`, `mgr`, `admin`) implemented.
    *   Case-insensitive header processing with whitespace trimming implemented.
*   ✅ **Enhanced Error Handling**:
    *   Best-effort processing for `apply`, continuing on per-row failures implemented.
    *   Error collection and final summary reports implemented.
    *   Proper exit codes (0=success, 1=error) implemented.
*   ✅ **Operational Tooling**:
    *   **Logging**: Structured logging to `.jsonl` files in `./runs/YYYY-MM-DD/` directories implemented.
    *   **Progress Feedback**: Progress indication for long-running operations.
    *   **Performance Safeguards**: `--max-records` flag (default 5000) with `--force` override implemented.
    *   **Checkpoint System**: Idempotent checkpoint files with `--resume` capability implemented.
*   ✅ **SDK Reliability**:
    *   All mutating SDK calls followed by `api.sync_down()` to prevent cache-related race conditions.

#### **2.8. Atomic Architecture Benefits** ✅ ACHIEVED

The atomic architecture refactoring achieved the following benefits:

**✅ Atomicity**: Each component has a single, well-defined responsibility:
- `AtomicValidationService`: Only handles CSV validation
- `AtomicTemplateService`: Only handles template generation  
- `AtomicProvisioningService`: Only handles permissions provisioning
- Infrastructure adapters isolate external dependencies

**✅ Reusability**: Components can be composed and reused:
- Services can be used independently or together
- Adapters can be swapped (e.g., MockKeeperAdapter for testing)
- Domain models are shared across services

**✅ Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and dependencies:
- Domain logic isolated from infrastructure concerns
- Clean interfaces between layers
- Easy to test with mocked dependencies

**✅ Clarity**: Self-documenting code with consistent patterns:
- Clear naming conventions (`Atomic*`, `*Adapter`, `*Service`)
- Explicit dependency injection
- Type hints throughout
